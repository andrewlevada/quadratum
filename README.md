**Project status**: I managed to design and develop the first version. However it wasn't very enjoyable, so the project is frozen. I might return to it, when google calendar breaks)

**Motivation**: I could not find a task tracker that would accuratly represent my prefered way of managing or even conceptually representing tasks. So i have descided to create yet another task tracker.

**Focus points:**
1. Simple
2. Aesthetic and highly customizible (visually)
3. Assisting in it's nature
