**Motivation**: I simply can not find task tracker that would accuratly represent my prefered way of managing and even conceptually thinking about tasks. So as a product creator, I have descided to create yet another task tracker.

**Focus points:**
1. Simple
2. Aesthetic and highly customizible (visually)
3. Assisting in it's nature
